# Final_Portfolio

This is a responsive portfolio that showcases some of the projects that I developed (or helped develop) during coding bootcamp.  On the last page it includes links that allow a visitor to contact me.

The project images can be clicked to go to the deployed project site.

Still to do:

- email form will send to my email, but doesn't yet render input fields to the email.

- final php project deployed to heroku but fails on login.  It works fine locally.  Repair soon.

- Improve responsiveness of pages.
