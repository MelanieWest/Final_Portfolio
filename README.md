# Final_Portfolio

This is a responsive portfolio that showcases some of the projects that I developed (or helped develop) during coding bootcamp.  
The last page contains information about me, as well as contact information. (all pages have links for contacting me).

The project images can be clicked to go to the deployed project sites.

All connection images are links to my sites

Email link will begin an email to me.

The final PHP project still has deployment issues (though it runs fine locally).  This will be repaired soon.
